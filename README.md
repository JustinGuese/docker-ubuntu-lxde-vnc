# docker-ubuntu-lxde-vnc

A simple docker image containing a GUI (lxde), firefox, python

## Why?

I first tried to use https://github.com/ConSol/docker-headless-vnc-container or https://hub.docker.com/r/dorowu/ubuntu-desktop-lxde-vnc/, but they were too old to install new packages.

They also didn't link the Dockerfile, so I couldn't see what they were doing.

Personally I am using this to run a selenium firefox browser with an extension, as I couldn't use it with selenium grid/remote.

## How to use

docker
